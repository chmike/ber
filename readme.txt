A note on this BER package
--------------------------
 
This package provides the primitives to compile or disassemble SNMP packets.
It is aimed to be part of an SNMP implementation.
 
It's originality is in the way SNMP packets are compiled. Packets are
compiled in reverse order, that is beginning from the last byte to the
first one. Due to the SNMP packet structure, it simplifies the code
and thus speed up the process.
 
The SNMP packet format is like an onion for which each layer is a data block.
A data block is defined as the following sequence: a tag, the data length and
the data itself. The problem when compiling SNMP packets is that the length
of the data is only known when it is compiled and that the data length field
must be encoded in varying length.
 
Thus compiling from the most inner layer toward the most outher layer is
the most simple and efficient way to proceed. The type of data to compile
allows such a reverse compiling. Apparently compiling the data itself is also
simplified and thus optimized.
 
Examples:
 
compiling an sid in reverse is simply:
 
*--p = x & 0x7F;
while( x >>= 7 )
   *--p = x | 0x80;
 
where x is the sid ( must be unsigned ) and p the pointer on the first
byte of the compiled data.
 
compiling an unsigned integer:
 
len = 1;
*--p = x;
while( x >>= 7 ){
   *--p = x >>= 1;
   len++;
}
*--p = len;
 
But then a buffer that may contain the biggest SNMP data must be provided at
the begining of compilation process. The size of such buffer is fixed (SNMPv1)
or known at the beginning of the compilation (SNMPv2 party information).
 
 
Boundary checking
-----------------
 
None of the primitives does bounds checking. It is the responsability of the
package user to test for boundary overflow. But some utility functions
helping in this type of tests are given for compilation.
 
 
Usefull primitives
------------------
 
The isObjectOf primitive allows to test if the submitted OID is a sub-object
or an instance of a another given OID. This is usefull when using get_next
functions to test if the received OID is out of the explored object group.
 
This function implements the test by simply comparing the OID common parts,
but again in reverse order. With get_next, the last bytes of an OID
will most probably differ and the first bytes will most probably be the same.
So comparing by starting from the end allows to make the decision very
rappidely in the context of get_next.
 
 
No OID parsing primitive
------------------------
 
It was decided not to give OID parsing primitive because OID should be
kept in compact form as long as possible. For a table retrieval with get_next
it is useless to unpack the OID to pack it again to compile the next get_next.
The isObjectOf function is not much slower on the compact form than on the
uncompacted. OID unpacking may be only pertinent for INDEX part of some OIDs.
This is the reason why no parse_oid function was given. But an sid (OID
sub-identifiers) counter was given that can apply on an OID part and a
parse_sid function. These two primitives allows to easely parse an OID.
 
Nevertheless an OID build function using an array of unsigned long as input
was given for compatibility with existent MIB engines.
 
 
Macro definitions
-----------------
 
Primitives where defined as functions, not as macros.
It may be interesing for the build_tag or parse_tag functions to use
macros instead. Such enhancement are left to the user of this package.
The reason is because the decision between speed or space priority is context
dependant. It is thus left to the user's appreciation.
 
 
Have fun...
